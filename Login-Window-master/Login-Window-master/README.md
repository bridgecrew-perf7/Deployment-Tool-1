# Login-Window

This is an example of how you can make a login window.

Change the display style in the code behind file to shop only one side of the window.
Please note that for the local login you have to write some code that you can select a database in the combobox.

In the top right of the windows you find a button with some gears as image. Click on it and a new Window will pop up. In it you will see some System Information.
